Propty is an app for locating nearby properties and saving them for later viewing.

Upon first launching the app, the user must allow location services in order to receive nearby properties from Foursquare API.

Swiping right on any cell and choosing "Save" action will save the property for later viewing. When saved, the property can be removed, again with swiping right and choosing the appropriate "Remove" action.

Swiping left on any cell will reveal the expected "Delete" action.

Pulling down the view refreshes the list and fills with a new set of Properties if user's location has changed.

Currently selecting any cell will only reveal the address of the Property if it has been received from the Foursquare API, otherwise just the name will be displayed.
